# Pong Challenge

A browser-based Pong-style game featuring a human-controlled paddle at the bottom of the court and a bot opponent guarding the top. Keep the ball in play to score points while the AI does its best to return each shot.

## Getting Started

1. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
2. Use the **left/right arrow keys** or **A/D** to move your paddle. You can also move your mouse (or touch) across the court to aim more quickly.
3. Deflect the ball back toward the bot. If the bot misses, you gain a point. Miss a shot and the bot scores instead.
4. Use the **Reset Match** button to start a new round and clear the score.

Have fun!
